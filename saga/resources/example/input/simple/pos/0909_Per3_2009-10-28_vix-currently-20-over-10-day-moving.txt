Perhaps more importantly, the VIX is at its second highest level relative to its 10 day simple moving average (+20.0%) since the November 20, 2008 all-time high close of 80.86.<br>Short-term, this is a bullish oversold signal for stocks, but now investors have to be wary that the SPX has also broken its 50 day moving average level of 1050.<br>Some of my earlier analysis suggested a good target bottom for the SPX is in the 1037-1041 range. With a little more than 20 minutes to go in today’s session, we are just a couple of points away from the top of that range.<br>Disclosure : Short VIX at time of writing.<br>Posted by Bill Luby at 12:38 PM  <br>Labels: 10 day SMA , VIX spikes<br><br>
