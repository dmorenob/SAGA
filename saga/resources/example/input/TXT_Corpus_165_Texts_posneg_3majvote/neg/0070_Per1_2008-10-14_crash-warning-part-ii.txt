Earlier today, ALL of our NEoWave Trading customers Shorted the S&P near the highs (around 1040 and 1019 in the Dec. Futures). <br>Based on current, short-term wave structure, the S&P is now at risk of its LARGEST, FASTEST, MOST VIOLENT DECLINE IN HISTORY!!!<br>PLEASE protect yourself and don't get caught in the "bargain hunting, and the market is bottoming," mentality.<br>Good Luck,<br>Glenn Neely<br>NEoWave, Inc. <br><br>
