Clean and turn the patient, hope that the treatment will eventually work.<br>Central bankers call it monetary policy. I call it socialization of losses and privatization of profits.<br>The bulls are partying like its 1999 having bull-slapped the bears into submission. Let's look at where we are through the not always rose-colored lens of charts and more. The Dow Jones Industrials weekly chart shows a strong move off the bottom for the past six weeks...with a double dose of Gann higher lows and higher highs. Another one of Gann's principals is the importance of time, with the importance of the length of rallies in changing trend. The longest previous rally exceeds the current duration of this rally.<br>____________________________________________________________<br>The daily chart?<br>Friday formed a Doji or 'indecision' candle<br>The overarching pattern remains a 'W' with lower highs...so far.<br>The RSI 7 panel (bottom) shows its own symmetry<br>The MACD shows it's thinking about a rollover<br>________________________________________________________________ Here's the Xinhua 25. As great as the liquidity bubble the Fed here is trying to restore, China is making the Bernanke Fed look like pikers as its lending grows dramatically and credit quality shrinks concurrently. Central bankers do know how to play that game. Note how Tim Geithner now claims China is not a currency manipulator...they're basically just good 'ol boys now. The FXI also has a 'W' pattern, but it's made the higher high.<br>__________________________________________________________<br>The diagnostic algorithm: using a variety of tools Momentum has been high...with the stochastics at the high end of the range on the SPX<br>_______________________________________________________<br>Overbought/oversold. The Mamis-Meisler 30 day oscillator is at its highest level in two years.<br>______________________________________________________<br>Sentiment: has gone over to the other side of the bus.<br>______________________________________________________<br>Trend: the ADX(14) on the SPX chart (vide supra) is still below 25...<br>______________________________________________________<br>Volatility: The VIX VIX has finally dropped more than 10 percent below its 10 period average, but hasn't reversed...extended buy not signalling as of yet.<br>__________________________________________________________<br>The game is simple enough, central bankers locked in a death struggle for 'competitive devaluation' of currency, credit bubble reflation, and risk transferred from the financiers to the public. Nice. The old grammar school spelling saw about exceptions ( i before e except after c or when sounded like a as in neighbor and weigh) strangely reappears: "Neither foreign financiers seized either species of weird leisure." Yes, the weird leisure we know as free markets. Fluff and buff.<br>Good trading and great risk management to all.<br>Educational use only. Never intended as investment advice.<br><br>
