The correction is indicated by breaks of<br>the market and its 10 day m/a below the 25 day m/a and the fact<br>that the 25 day m/a is starting to roll over (See chart link below).<br>The SP 500, now 1045, would fall out of consolidation below short<br>term support of 1025.<br>The market, on my measures, is only modestly oversold at current<br>levels, and would need to fall to the 1010 - 1020 range to give a<br>stronger, more respectable oversold reading. That range would<br>also be equal to a 7 - 8% correction off the 10 /15 rally high of<br>1097 (closing). An 8% pullback represents a goodly shorter term<br>correction in a cyclical advance.<br>Since the market has broken its uptrend line from 3/09 and since it<br>failed to take out trend resistance dating back to the '2007 highs,<br>we have a situation that commands attention.<br>I would also note that I have a sell signal from my smoothed 40<br>wk. oscillator, which went definitively positive in mid - March ' 09<br>and stayed that way until this past Fri. This indicator can whipsaw<br>like any other, but long experience says a change in direction is<br>well worth attention. This is a momentum oscillator which puts<br>weekly closes against the 40 wk m/a and which is smoothed out to<br>13 weeks.<br>I will happily concede that the market can confound the short term<br>situation by swinging back into rally mode, but my work is now<br>flashing amber or caution.<br>Looking long term, this upleg since 3/09 represents one of the<br>more powerful 6 - 7 month advances in history and the market<br>today is trading well above levels indicated by a more typical<br>cyclical advance. From a historical perspective, it is wise to<br>figure that this powerful upleg will transform into a more normal<br>one at least for a while, but just how that situation may eventuate is<br>something that one can probably only guess at. I have been thinking<br>that there could be another leg up to the current advance before a<br>more rugged correction takes hold, but that awaits resolution of<br>this current cautionary period which I have been looking for since<br>mid - Sept. '09 (See 9/20 post).<br>Sp 500 chart .<br>posted by Peter Richardson at 3:03 PM<br><br>
