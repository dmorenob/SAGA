Crashing stock markets are a great thing. And the reason why is unless you are retiring tomorrow, you’ll be able to pick up stocks all that much cheaper. Instead of paying $100 for a share of IBM you’re paying $40. Instead of $200 for Merck, you’re paying $125. Ergo why, especially the younger generations, should be cheering for a collapse in the stock market.<br><br>But what is interesting is trying to find out precisely when the mar ket will bottom out. When is the “ultimate” or “ideal” time to buy. I know many people have been saying, “Hey, now’s the time, it doesn’t get any better than this” but allow me to pour a little more rain on the parade.<br><br>Based on P/E ratios furnished by Dr. Shiller at Yale, the S&P 500 as of August was still trading above its historical P/E average of 16 (the red line), trading roughly around a P/E of 20. Now this does not include the 25% drop in the S&P 500 that has occurred since August. Even adjusting for that (and assuming earnings don’t tank further), the stock markets are at best…<br><br>Accurately valued.<br><br>Sorry to tell all you people that, but right here is where the markets are in line with their historical valuations. The Dow Jones at 9,500 and the S&P 500 at around 1,000 is where things should roughly be. This is “correct.” This is “about right.”<br><br>Ergo, you should not be loading up on stocks now, because you’d be paying the historically average price of a stock which is $16 in stock price for each $1 in earnings. You’re not getting a deal, you’re paying retail. People should wait for the market to REALLY go on sale, and with a recession guaranteed, it’s almost a surety it will. You laugh at Cramer suggesting a 7,700 Dow, just like my big time former employers laughed at me when I said there was a housing bubble (and an Asian currency crisis and a Dotcom Bubble), but you might just want to (for a change) listen.<br><br>Post Script - many thanks to Dr. Glenn Reynolds at Instapundit for the link. For those visiting from Instapundit, I would be immeasurably grateful if you could mayhaps suggest to Dr. Reynolds that he take a look at my book so that I may attain my goal of beating Nancy Pelosi in book sales.<br><br>
