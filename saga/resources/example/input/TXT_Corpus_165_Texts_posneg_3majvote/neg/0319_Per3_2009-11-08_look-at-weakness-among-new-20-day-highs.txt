Much of that weakness can be traced to relative weakness among small cap stocks. For example, my ever-trusty Decision Point service notes that 58% of S&P 500 large cap issues are trading above their 20-day exponential moving averages, but only 38% of S&P 600 small caps and 45% of S&P 400 midcaps. I will be watching closely early this week to see if the market bounce from recent lows can broaden. If not, I will be viewing that bounce as part of an longer-term topping process that goes back to momentum highs in September.<br>.<br><br>
