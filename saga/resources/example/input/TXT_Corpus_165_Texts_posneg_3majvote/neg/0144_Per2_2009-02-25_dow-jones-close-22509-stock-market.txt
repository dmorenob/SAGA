The Dow Jones Futures were down this morning and the bank stocks started the day strong, were weak, and then broke through their highs of the day going into the close. At 3pm, Bank of America ( BAC ) traded at $5.35 up 13% and Citigroup ( C ) was $2.79 Up 7.50%. The banking stock surge combined with Gold prices falling, caused the overall stock market to rally off the lows. Oil also spiked higher today on a bullish oil inventory number. It appears demand for gasoline is starting to increase and this is bullish for oil prices.<br>I personally think this rally is just a typical bear market rally, we haven't addressed anything new with the banking problem. We only had a few comments by our government hinting at anti nationalization of some banks. The losses aren't going away any time soon. No one really knows how good or bad the situation is. I continue to watch the S&P 500. Support is at 741 and if this level is broken the current leg down will get much worse. Having said that, rallies can last for a long time...it is very bullish that over the past two days, each major dip has been bought. With minutes to go until the close, the Dow Jones went from up 40 to down 75, a 115 point move in about 20 minutes. Obama is speaking about a banking plan lol. On no!! It's time for Government to stop talking and start taking action.<br>I will have full technical analysis of the stock market tonight - Right Here<br>Today's Biggest Stock Market Gainers - Top 2009 Stock Gainers - Top 2009 Penny Stocks - Baltic Dry Index<br>For the latest updates on the stock market, visit, http://daytradingstockblog.blogspot.com/ or Subscribe for Free<br><br>
