But I’ll wait until Monday before downgrading the intermediate-term to down from up.<br>The bottom line: 1.2.1 Dow Theory: Averages Must Confirm , breadth extremely overbought and TRAN not confirming INDU's new high. I expect at least 10% correction.<br>SHORT-TERM: BEARISH ENGULFING AND STICK SANDWICH FORMED ON THE SPY DAILY CHART<br>We had yet another reversal day on Friday (Open high but close in red. Yeah, yeah, I know how a “Key Reversal” day is defined, this just is my way of a reversal day. And by the way, statistically, a “Key Reversal” day actually doesn’t mean a reversal…). The chart below shows all the similar reversal days since March: The chances are good that SPY will consolidate then pullback. Therefore the short-term either we may see a few days consolidation or the consolidation was over, the pullback starts next week.<br> <br>0.0.2 SPY Short-term Trading Signals , Bearish Engulfing and Stick Sandwich, looks bearish. As mentioned in the After Bell Quick Summary , the green line below is very important. See chart 1.0.3 S&P 500 SPDRs (SPY 30 min) , if broken then a 1-2-3 formation will be formed with target at 105ish?Of course, bulls have their chances:  a Symmetrical Triangle is in the forming. Anyway, I mean it’s too early to call who’s going to win now, let’s wait and see.<br> <br>Take a look at the chart below: too many stocks in SPX reached Buying Climaxes this week (see red bars), not so good. By the way, this indicator is part of the Investors Intelligence paid services, I made it by myself according its definition and I’ll watch it from now on. Hopefully it could save you a few bucks.<br>Buying & Selling Climaxes<br>Investors Intelligence uses this term to describe a more specific event which occurs over a one week period.<br>A buying climax is where a stock makes a new 52 week high but then closes below the previous week’s close.<br>A selling climax is where a stock makes a new 52 week low and then closes above the previous week’s close.<br>The reason that we use such a rigid definition for climaxes is that this enables us to classify accurately and consistently what is and what isn’t a climax. This is important as we maintain historic records of the climaxes generated each week and have noted that important market turning points are often accompanied by a sudden rise in the number of buying or selling climaxes.<br>A great example of this was in October 2002 when the Dow Industrials made its final low. At this point, our US Market Timing Service observed a massive increase in the number of US stocks generating selling climaxes. By communicating this to subscribers, we were able to provide a good early indication that a bounce was on the cards.<br>  INTERESTING CHARTS:<br>  3.3.0 streetTRACKS Gold Trust Shares (GLD Daily) , Ascending Triangle, so gold could rise further, May not be on Monday though.<br>3.4.2 United States Oil Fund, LP (USO 30 min) , Descending Triangle, could be a short-term pullback.<br><br>
