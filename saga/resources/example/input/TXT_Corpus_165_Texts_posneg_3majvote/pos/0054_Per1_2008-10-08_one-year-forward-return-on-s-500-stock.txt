And the average one year forward return during those 59 days was a market beating 22.13%.<br>Today's HOLU Value is 36.79%, with the 52 week S&P 500 low of 996.23, and the 52 week high of 1576.09.<br>The highest HOLU value during this period was 44.11% on October 3, 1974.<br>The longest time period where the HOLU value remained above 30% was from August 14, 1974 to October 9, 1974 with the exception of two days in this period where the HOLU briefly went under 30%.<br>Time to Accumulate?<br>Based on this, now might be a good time to be a contrarian and start accumulating index funds or ETFs .<br>However, the market could still go lower and possibly approach the record 44.11% HOLU value on October 3, 1974.<br>But for the true long term investor, having a cost basis around this level or lower could be a profitable move.<br>Today's S&P 500<br><br>
