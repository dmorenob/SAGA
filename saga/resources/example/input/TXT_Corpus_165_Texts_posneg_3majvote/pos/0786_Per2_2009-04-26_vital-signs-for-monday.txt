If the market rallies, then it was because oil prices fell, Company A reported better than expected earnings, or government mouthpiece B sees light at the end of the tunnel. The problem, of course, follows that earnings may not necessarily weigh in with the same heft as the exuberance generated. Of course, it works the other way, too.<br>So let's look at our diagnostic algorithm.<br>Momentum: Momentum has moved up with stochastics actually coming in recently.<br>----------------------------------------<br>Overbought-oversold status:<br>The Mamis-Meisler breadth oscillator is perilously close to giving a sell signal, a downward cross of the short over the long average of breadth, with both heading south. I'm not willing to call this OBJECTIVELY yet.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Sentiment<br>Sentimentrader shows modest contrarian optimism.<br>The addition of the OEX put call ratios may add more concern for bulls.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Trend:<br>The SP500 daily chart shows an ADX(14) of 14, positive, yet not meeting 'trending' criteria, with stronger trends 25 to 30 or more. The advantage of using indicators is a certain 'independence' of evaluation. The disadvantage is the rigidity of thought creating limitations.<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>Volatility/Bands<br>Naturally, the SPX per se doesn't define the market. Price MIGHT be making a relatively lower high when viewed through the prism of bands. Bollinger likes to consider money flow and it has slowed. Price is neither 'walking' up or down the bands or have the bands narrowed greatly.<br>_______________________________________<br>Trade Universe for Monday.<br>__________________________________________________________<br>Diagnostic tests help give us 'objective' parameters with which to follow the market. Evaluating the 'vital signs' of the market don't tell us everything, because at very best, technical analysis provides guidelines not stone tablets.<br>Economic data all too often comes heavily massaged. Employment data suffers mightily from the "birth-death" effect and CPI data suffers the triple flaws of substitution, weighting, and hedonics in order to misrepresent actual prices. So as speculators, we are left with flawed data and the need to identify when we have an edge and when we do not. Wall Street is not their to facilitate our wealth, but theirs...and we should NEVER forget that.<br>Good trading and great risk management to all.<br>Educational use only.
