The pattern will display two highs touching the upper trend line and two lows touching the lower trend line.<br>This pattern is confirmed when the price breaks upward out of the Triangle/Wedge formation to close above the upper trend line.<br>Volume is an important factor to consider. Typically, volume follows a reliable pattern: volume should diminish as the price swings back and forth between an increasingly narrow range of highs and lows. However, when the breakout occurs, there should be a noticeable increase in volume. If this volume picture is not clear, investors should be cautious about decisions based on this Triangle/Wedge."<br><br>As the website suggests, the reversal won't occur after a successful breakout with good volume above the upper trend line of the Triangle/Wedge Pattern.<br>As of Wednesday, October 22, 2008, we are at the bottom end of the triangle, and if the pattern holds, we may eventually get a breakout on the upside.<br>But as with all patterns, patterns are not guarantees and patterns can fail.<br>For more details of the Bottom Triangle Wedge Pattern, see the Trending123 Article on this.<br><br>Today's S&P 500 Stock Chart<br><br>
