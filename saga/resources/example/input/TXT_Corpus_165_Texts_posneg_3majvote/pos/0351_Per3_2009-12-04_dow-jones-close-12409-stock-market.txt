The Dow Jones Futures surged in pre market when we found out that the US only lost 11,000 jobs in the month of November in addition to positive revisions to the prior months. The unemployment rate fell to 10%. This news caused the stock market averages as well as the US Dollar to both surge. We also saw money come out of Gold as the metal fell over $60.<br>After it appeared the stock market could be up huge with the US Dollar, the Dollar began to build steadily on It's gains throughout the trading day. The stock market then began to tank! The Dollar basically went from $75.20 to $75.85 which was bearish for stocks and gold.<br>The dollar seems to be moving higher due to short covering and the fact that positive job growth could spur the Fed to raise interest rates sooner then expected. As you can see, there are a lot of moving parts in the stock market right now. Next week will be light on economic data so I'd expect the volume to be light. I am watching 1120-1130 on the S&P 500, if we can closes above 1130, we will begin the next leg higher.<br>As for the jobs, I am expecting us to actually create new jobs this month but the jury is still out for the first three months of 2010.<br>Check out some additional events I will be watching for Friday.<br>I will also have technical analysis of the stock market - Right Here<br>Today's Biggest Gainers - Top 2009 Stock Gainers - Top 2009 Penny Stocks - Hot OTC Stocks - Baltic Dry Index<br>For the latest updates on the stock market, visit, http://daytradingstockblog.blogspot.com/ or Subscribe for Free<br><br>
