The Dow Jones Futures were slightly higher in pre market and then stocks surged on postive Durable Goods & New Home Sales data.<br>There was a failed UK debt offering overnight but Wall Street seemed to ignore this until we had some demand issues with our debt offerings during the afternoon. All the major stock market averages reversed and began to tank rapidly. The S&P 500 broke 800 and hit a low of 791.40 before bouncing back above the 800 level. Financial Bull ( FAS ) stock broke $6.00 and went down another $0.50 before bouncing back above $6.00. The fact that every major dip seems to be bought is a very positive sign. In the final minutes, it was like we never sold off!!
