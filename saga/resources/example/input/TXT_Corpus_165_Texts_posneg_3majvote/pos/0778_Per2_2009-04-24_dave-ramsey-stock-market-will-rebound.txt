And it might happen sooner than you think it will. Just look at the past bear markets the stock market has overcome.<br>What you see below is a graph of past bear markets and how they affected the S&P 500. The graph shows, on average, how long a bear market lasted and how much the stocks improved after it ended.<br><br>As you can see, the average bear market lasted around 13 months. Even more revealing is that, on average, the S&P 500 recovered all of its value and more within one to two years after the bear market ended.<br>If you cashed out your investments during one of those bear markets, you would have missed out on about a 50% gain. That’s a lot of money!<br>So what does history teach us?<br>1. Don’t cash out your investments during a bear market. If you do, you may lock in the losses and miss the rebound of the stock market.<br><br>2. Never give up hope. This recession and the bear market will end. You and your investments will be stronger in the long run. Sphere: Related Content<br><br>
