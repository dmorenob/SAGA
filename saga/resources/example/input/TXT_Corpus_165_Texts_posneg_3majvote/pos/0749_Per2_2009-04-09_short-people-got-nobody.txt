Will it stick? Somewhere I read that on the NDX, you could judge premarket volume on MXIM, AMAT, NVLS, KLAC and see whether large openings would stick...if they all were high (? > 50K shares) then that was supportive. I've never seen anything similar on the SPX.<br>Here are the "stochastics oversold" stocks (under four percent) from the SPX. Not a big crowd...and these are sorted by 5 day stochastics, not 14.<br>____________________________________<br>And if we look for stocks with RSI7 (weekly) values under 30, the pickings are slim indeed.<br>__________________________________________________________<br>Or we could look at the 100 MUST stocks for those with inside days and see how many shape up as NR7s as well (volatility expansion setups)<br>___________________________________________________________<br>Lots of ways to play the game. The SEC is focused like a laser beam on ensuring that short sellers don't take down the market. Too bad they don't bother to attend to their regulatory duties with the same fervor. We don't see heads rolling over the Madoff scandal, but let's work on changing the rules as though that's the problem with the crookedness of the game.<br>Barry Ritholtz makes it simple: his quote below<br>Short sellers (SS) didn’t get people to buy homes with no money down, SS didn’t convince people to buy homes with teaser rates, SS didn’t convince people to lie about their income on their mortgage applications, SS didn’t tell banks/brokers to lever up to such huge levels, SS didn’t tell Greenspan to cut rates to 1% and leave it there, SS didn’t invent FNM and FRE, SS didn’t tell the OTS, OCC, FDIC, Fed, SEC, FFIEC, FTC, FHFA and all the state regulators to twiddle their thumbs all day, SS didn’t tell the rating agencies to rate AAA on anything that moved, SS didn’t tell banks to lend to commercial real estate investors on a property where the rent didn’t cover the mortgage payment, SS didn’t tell the average consumer to spend more money than they make and borrow difference.<br>Short selling is a legitimate form of speculation that fully enhances market liquidity and price discovery.<br>"One day at a time."<br>Good trading and great risk management to all.<br>Educational use only.
