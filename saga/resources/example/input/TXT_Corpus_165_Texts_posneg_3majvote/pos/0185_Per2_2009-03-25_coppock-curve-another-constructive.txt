Which indicators told us that the market had hit peaks in the past and can those same indicators tell us when we hit a bottom?<br>Those are questions that investors have been asking almost since the beginning. First there was Charles Dow who, through a long series of articles in his Wall Street Journal formulated what would later be called the Dow Theory. A Dow contemporary was Richard Wyckoff who, around 1907, "cobbled together his concepts in a less technologically sophisticated era (he strongly advocated careful "tape reading" to get a feel of market direction and momentum)". I inserted a chart of Wyckoff's principals in "A Selling Climax Behind Us?" written on November 24, 2008 .<br>Another was Edwin Coppock who developed an indicator, later dubbed the Coppock Curve (or "Guide"). The Guide is not for short-term traders since it attempts to measure major turns in market momentum. As I wrote on January 8 , I first ran across Coppock's Curve while reading "Coppock Guide Update & Forecast for 2009" at Trader's Narrative and wrote: "As recently as July 27, 2007, Forbes.com ran a story based on the Coppock Guide that turned out to be fairly prescient and unfortunate because, believe it or not, the Coppock Guide was indicating a turn in market sentiment and momentum to the negative."<br>So what does Coppock's Guide indicate now? What does the Curve now say about the possibility of a turn in market momentum? Pictures (or charts) are worth a thousand words and the a chart of Coppock's Curve is quite revealing:<br>The above chart uses the Coppock methodology, indicates that the Curve peaked in October, 2007, coincidentally with the top of the S&P 500 Index. I've also extrapolated what the Curve values might be if the S&P 500 Index is able to hold at approximately 900 through the end of May. Interestingly, the Curve hits a low in April and begins to turn up in May.<br>So long as there's no further deterioration in the market, and the S&P 500 Index can hold current levels for the next 60 days, there's a convergence of indicators that will point to a positive signal at that time that it will be "all right to get back into the pool". Among those indicators are the Coppock Curve, the 200-day Moving Average crossover, my MTI, and the long-term reversion to the mean chart .<br>Labels: Disciplines , Momentum , Stock Markets , Technical Analysis<br>PERMALINK   12 comments<br><br>
