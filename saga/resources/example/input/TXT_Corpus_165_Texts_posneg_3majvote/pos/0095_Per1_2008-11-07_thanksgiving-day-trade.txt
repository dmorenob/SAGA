Im sure all of you guys and gals are well aware of the bullish seasonality the day before and day after Thanksgiving. I learned about this Thanksgiving seasonality in 2 of my favorite books. Stock Traders Almanac & Martin Zweigs winning on wall street . Historically buying on the close the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and selling on the close the Friday after thanksgiving would have yielded far superior returns when compared to a typical two day return. The edge in the S&P is 5 times larger than a random, 2 day holding period and the edge in the NASDAQ is 51 times larger than a random 2 day holding period with 83% of all occurrences being winners.
