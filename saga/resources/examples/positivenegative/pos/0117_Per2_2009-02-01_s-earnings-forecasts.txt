This includes a forecast of upcoming quarterly earnings. Here's a chart of the current (1/22/2009) forecasts:<br>First, note that during the last recession (.com bubble), it took 3 full years for earnings to recover to the previous peak.<br>Right now, earnings are at 1999 levels, a 55% drop from the peak in mid-2007. The current forecasts go through the end of 2010, and predict a modest gain, but not a recovery.<br>Forecasts are, of course, largely backwards looking, and are revised constantly. However, this probably captures as best as anything the prevailing thinking on the economy: i.e. that it's going to be a long hard road for a while.<br>Labels: Economic Indicators<br>posted by Chen @ 6:34 PM   0 Comments<br><br>
