That's lower than the intra-day low (742.61) on December 5, 1996 —the day Alan Greenspan gave his famous "irrational exuberance" speech . The closing price that day was 744.38. If it doesn't happen today, we will likely close below that level within the next week or so.<br>From that day until today, you would have been better off investing in short-term Treasury bonds.<br>Update: The S&P 500 ended the day at 735.09, lower than when Alan Greenspan warned of a possible stock market bubble over 12 years ago.<br><br>
