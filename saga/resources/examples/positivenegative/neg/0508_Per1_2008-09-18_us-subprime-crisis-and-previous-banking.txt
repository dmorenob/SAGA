While based on a relatively small sample, the authors selected examples deemed relevant to the subprime crisis (starting year is in parenthesis) :<br>The Big Five Crises: Spain (1977), Norway (1987), Finland (1991), Sweden (1991) and Japan (1992) Other Banking and Financial Crises: Australia (1989), Canada (1983), Denmark (1987), France (1994),Germany (1977), Greece (1991), Iceland (1985), and Italy (1990), New Zealand (1987), UK (1974, 1991, 1995), US (1984) The paper contains a series of graphs, illustrating the impact of the crises on various financial/economic indicators. First some notation:<br>T - 1 = year before the crisis<br>T = year the crisis hits<br>T + 1 = year after the crisis In the case of the U.S. subprime mess, the authors used 2007 as the year the crisis began (T=2007). Banking crises have a profound impact on housing prices: in the graph below U.S. prices are from the Case-Shiller index, and international prices are from BIS.<br>(Click to enlarge .)<br>The chart is consistent with other studies that suggest that a steep rise in housing prices usually precedes a (bank-centered) financial crisis. The chart also seems to agree with suggestions that the housing market is set to decline even further, at least over the next year or two. [ UPDATE (9/22/2008): Based on current prices in futures markets, prices are projected to decline another 16%.]<br>Next, the authors compared the behavior of equity markets -- using the S&P 500 in the U.S. and comparable stock market indices in the other countries:<br>Unfortunately, the anticipated drawdown in the S&P 500 is occurring right now! As the authors observed:<br>The Big Five crisis countries tended to experience equity price falls earlier on than the U.S. has, perhaps because the U.S. Federal Reserve pumped in an extraordinary amount of stimulus in the early part of the most recent episode. The large size of the U.S. Current Account Deficit notwithstanding (more than 6% of GDP), the U.S. Current Account also seems to closely track previous crises.<br><br>The impact of back-centered financial crisis on economic growth can be profound:<br><br>On average, GDP growth remained low for two years, or in the case of the worse crises (the "Big Five"), low to negative GDP growth for three years . Prudence dictates that one should assume a sluggish economy through 2009/2010.<br>More recently, we have analysts expressing concern over government bailouts of large institutions and companies (to date: Fannie/Freddie, Bear Stearns, and AIG). The primary concern (besides Moral Hazard ) expressed is that taxpayers are already saddled with debt, and bailouts potentially add to this debt burden. The graph below tracks public debt as a (normalized) share of GDP:<br><br>Look for public debt to grow over the next few years, with the graph potentially (massively) understating the debt problem in the U.S.:<br>Rising public debt is a near universal precursor of other post-war crises, not least the 1984 U.S. crisis. It is notable that U.S. public debt rises much more slowly than it did in run-up to the Big Five crisis. However, if one were to incorporate the huge buildup in private U.S. debt into these measures, the comparisons would be notably less favorable. In conclusion, the combination of these metrics/graphs places the U.S. subprime crisis in context . The previous 18 bank-centered crises used in the study provide clues to the possible near-term (2 to 4 years) impact of the subprime crisis. While historical data can never completely forecast what will happen to the U.S. economy over the next few years, we can use "similar" crises to paint likely scenarios of how things will play out. I prefer the systematic use of data over explanations and forecasts based on one or two historical examples. The conditions over the next few months remain volatile, and as the authors noted, the chances of a severe recession were high even before this week's events:<br>... The correlations in these graphs are not necessarily causal, but in combination nevertheless suggest that if the United States does not experience a significant and protracted growth slowdown, it should either be considered very lucky or even more “special” that most optimistic theories suggest. Indeed, given the severity of most crisis indicators in the run-up to its 2007 financial crisis, the United States should consider itself quite fortunate if its downturn ends up being a relatively short and mild one.<br>UPDATE (9/25/2008): The Wall Street Journal has an article on previous financial crises.<br>UPDATE (10/7/2008): Econobrowser on the severity of the downturn . Here are two visuals worth looking at: Graph I , Graph II .<br><br>
