Today's numbers were the worst I have ever seen. From Kevin:<br>Here is where we stand with the point and figure bullish percent indicators for equities, based on Investors Intelligence data.<br>NYSE Bullish Percent: Os (Negative) 9% - lowest since 1987<br>S&P 500 Bullish Percent: Os (Negative) 7.9% - exceeds 2002 and 1998 lows<br>Nasdaq Composite Bullish Percent: Os (Negative) 13.4% - lowest since 1987<br>Nasdaq-100 Bullish Percent: Os (Negative) 4% - in 2001, this indicator actually reached 0<br>Russell 2000 Bullish Percent: Os (Negative) 14.1% - equals January low<br>NYSE High-Low Index: Os (Negative) 2.5%<br>Nasdaq High-Low: Os (Negative) 2.8%<br>It is easy to be bearish given the circumstances, but the fact of the matter is these indicators are so washed out and so low that the probabilities increasingly favor a sustainable rally. Given the macro headwinds combined with approaching earnings season, it is doubtful this is THE bottom, but we are nearing, or at, a low. Keep in mind, these are probabilities. The market may simply continue lower. Yesterday's action was not capitulation in the traditional sense.<br>Based on some additional technical work I have been looking at SP 960 as a downside target with the intention of buying on moves below 1000. Here is a chart I am looking at from an Elliott Wave Perspective.<br>$SPX Monthly Chart<br><br>click on chart for sharper image<br>If this is a wave 5 decline, the target for wave 3 would be near 966 (1.618 * Wave 1).<br>In Elliott Wave terms, crash wave 3 may be nearly finished. Of course that means wave 4 (a correction up) and wave 5 (yet another move lower) are coming up.<br>Risk reward is no longer on the short side even if longer term fundamental issues to the downside are not finished. This is a good place to be lightening up on shorts, taking profits on PUTs, and heading for the sidelines for further directional clues.<br>Mike "Mish" Shedlock<br>http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com<br>Click Here To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List<br>Short Term Eyes on SPX 960<br>Posted by Michael Shedlock at 12:55 PM ....
