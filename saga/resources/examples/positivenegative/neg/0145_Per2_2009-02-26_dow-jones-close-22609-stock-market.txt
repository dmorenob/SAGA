The day started with the Dow Jones Futures in positive territory due to a huge rise in the bank stocks early. The Dow Jones was up over 100 points at one point with the S&P 500 testing critical resistance of that 780 level. The Obama Tax Hike news started to sink in around noon as stocks retreated into negative territory. The Sallie Mae news was also viewed as Bearish. Once again, the Government is screwing with the stock market. Sallie Mae is now trashed! What is next? A Citigroup nationalization?<br>Anyway, details about the problem bank list were released in the afternoon as this started the steep decline we saw in the final hour. Most of the banking stocks that were up early rolled over hard. The Nasdaq was hit the hardest. The S&P 500 is now close to key support at 741, if that breaks, another leg down should follow.<br>Why were Gold Prices down today? I'd have to say it was a technical move down. Gold has had a huge run over the past month and given that bank stocks were very strong over the last few days, you are seeing some money rotating out of Gold. Don't worry, the money will come back into Gold soon.<br>Oil was up today on signs that the recent OPEC production cuts were taking effect. Oil closed over $45 per barrel but has come off the highs as the stock market plunged in the final hour. There is also rumors of additional cuts by OPEC in the coming months.<br>Today was an ugly day for stocks! But what do you expect? We are in a nasty bear market recession. Tomorrow could be another ugly day as well - I will post Futures tonight and also post full technical analysis of the Stock Market - Right Here<br>Today's Biggest Stock Market Gainers - Top 2009 Stock Gainers - Top 2009 Penny Stocks - Baltic Dry Index<br>For the latest updates on the stock market, visit, http://daytradingstockblog.blogspot.com/ or Subscribe for Free<br><br>
