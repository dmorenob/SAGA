With earnings season in full bloom, the release of GDP later in the week and a Fed meeting, the prospects for a further move higher in equity prices have been reexamined by traders and investors alike. The real question is whether corporations will continue to see the headwinds for a continued advance become too great in the wake of a growing unemployment issue and economic policy which, as recorded by a Bloomberg survey, has 77% of Americans feeling President Obama has done a poor job. How hard and how far will the pendulum swing…back to the center... or is the loud noise heard in Massachusetts last week the start of a new political reality?<br>The S&P 500 futures contract has started to show signs that it has begun a correction which could take us down anywhere from 5 to 10 percent. My feel is that a move down into the lower 1000’s, maybe the 1015 to 1020 area, would be a healthy 10% pullback. The move has started (this ride might not be suitable for children under 18, or those with heart conditions!!)…it’s time to either be prepared for the inevitable volatility or its time to step aside. Either way, it should be fun!!<br>-JB<br><br>
