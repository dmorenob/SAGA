It might be in black wave iv still however.<br><br>The chart above shows the count that is actually working presently. This forces it all into the larger P2 count as a nice neat little package just in time for Christmas . Bing it's magical! This count has us now in wave [iii] of C of (Z) of [P2].<br><br>Courtesy of Elliott Wave International. Used by permission.<br>Since we have all been having problems counting the dollar rally, I thought it was a good time to bring out the occasional allowed chart from Elliott Wave International. Hochberg has done a good job subdividing it. The chart shows an extended fifth wave and it is almost completed. I knew there was a 1-2, 1-2 in there.<br>The markets followed through on Monday with all major indices closing in the green. It was a broad based rally with some stronger than others. Small Caps did well again with a 1.42% gain. Mid Caps were in second place with a 1.35% gain. Russell 2000 (+1.32%).<br>The Nasdaq Composite (+1.17%) confirmed Friday's Bullish Kicking Candle. The Nasdaq 100 closed up +1.19%). While the techs performed worse than last Friday, the S&P 500 chalked up a bigger gain, closing up 1.05% vs. Friday's gain of .58%. The S&P 500 also confirmed Friday's candle. The Dow Jones also bested Friday's trading closing up .83% Monday vs. the paltry .20% gain for Friday's session.<br>No doubt that both the second wave push up and the completed ending diagonal counts are off the table. NYSE volume was muted compared to last Friday's session, but that was a special session and today was a holiday week Monday. So volume was not all that shabby and also about average for the last seven weeks. Quality of volume did improve with it's best showing in fourteen days.<br>Industry winners were Disk Drives ($DDX +2.76%), Semis ($SOX +2.27%), Retailers ($RLX +1.69%), and Oil ($XOI +1.53%).<br>My upside projections (SPX : 1111.2, SPY 111.42) posted over the weekend were met. Let's see if I can do it again. However there is one caveat. Chart 1 below is a 30 min. Minis chart. It looks like it may still be in wave 4. Therefore, the signal I am going to show you below on a Point and Figure chart below may not be valid and we certainly can't set fibs for Elliott Wave Theory projections if the fifth wave is not finished. I am ignoring the bull signal on the 1 min P and F chart tonight since it may have been triggered by an X wave up. Chart 2 is a 5 min. P and F. It gives a target of 1108.2. However, if the impulse is not finished, the signal is worthless. Both the 10 min and 15 min P and F charts presently have targets in the 1163s.<br><br>Chart 1<br>Chart 2<br>Chart 3 below shows how the 30 min P and F triggered a signal as it hit 1106.1. Hitting 1118.5 and 1121 will both trigger separate double top breakout signals. Chart 4 shows the fib retracement levels as they were left at the close. Chart 5 is an SPX Daily chart.<br>Chart 3<br><br>Chart 4<br>Chart 5<br><br>Ending Diagonal Watch. Well, things keep getting worse for this count. The competed ED count was whacked out Monday on the Nasdaq new high. So in addition to the problems of a wave [ii] ED and a wave [iv] impulse, we can add two more problems to the list. Wave [v] looks impulsive too. It also may not be finished, and it has only has a little room before it is too long. Wave five in an ending diagonal cannot be longer than wave 3.<br><br>
