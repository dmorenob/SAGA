How many people do you think called the October 1929 low of 195 "the bottom" only to get decimated by the continued weakness over the next 3 years? We remain in a bear market and ALL rallies should be treated as guilty until proven innocent, meaning you need to maintain a super strong defense. Do not be too quick to call Friday's low "the bottom", there are serious flaws in our economic system and a lot of closets with ugly contents are still being opened.<br><br>Dow Jones 1929-1933<br>Notice how insignificant October 1929 becomes when viewed on a larger timeframe.<br><br>Dow Jones October 1987<br><br>S&P 500 (SPY) 2000-2003<br><br><br>
