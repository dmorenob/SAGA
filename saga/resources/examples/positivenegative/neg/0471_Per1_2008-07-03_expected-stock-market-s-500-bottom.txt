The annotated chart above is from March 2008, but it still shows important levels).<br>Where's the bottom?<br>In technical analysis (analyzing the stock charts), there's a school of thinking that uses Fibonacci Retracements. In nature and in the stock market, the ratios of 61.8%, 50% and 38.2% are important levels. If we take any uptrend or downtrend in the stock market, if we look at the retracement levels (the levels at 61.8%, 50% and 38.2%), these levels often coincide with resistance and support levels.<br>On March 24, 2000, the S&P 500 hit an intraday high of 1552.87 . During that last bear market, the S&P 500 then lost almost 50% of it's value to an intraday low of 768.63 on October 10, 2002.<br>The most recent high today was set around with an intraday high of 1576 on October 11, 2007.<br>Over the last several months, the S&P 500 bounced nicely around the 1270 level, which coincides with the 38.2% retracement from the lows of 2002.<br>Now, it would appear that the S&P 500 could go lower. The 50% retracement from the 2002 S&P 500 lows would be 1172, and 1077 would be the 61.8% retracement.<br>Looking at the chart above, we also notice a lot of congestion from 2003 to 2006, in the range between 1077 to 1267. This is a good sign that we could find stronger support in this region.<br>Maybe 1077 could be a good lower target on the S&P 500 .<br>In addition, many sources claim that the average bear market decline is 30%. If this is so, then a 30% decline from 1576 would give us an S&P index value of 1104, very close to the 1077 S&P 500 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement.<br>The S&P 500 longer term bottom looks to be around 1077 to 1172 based on the scenario above.<br>Of course, we can monitor the situation of the S&P 500 at each support and resistance level.<br>Today's S&P 500 Chart, Long Term View<br>Today's Three Year S&P 500 Chart<br>Original Article which used the Annotated Chart Above<br><br>
