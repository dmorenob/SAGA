Wall Street did not like this one bit given today's trading. The Stock Market Futures were down this morning, The Dow Jones futures were actually down 100 at one point. Art Cashin gave some comments on retesting the lows this morning. Most stocks have been hit hard today! Google ( GOOG ) traded below $300 for the first time since 2005 as analysts who have been very late pile on and downgrade the company. Last week, Google was $370, but Barclays and Goldman Sachs wait until $300 to issue negative comments, it really makes no sense. Citigroup ( C ) is now in the single digits like Meredith Whitney said. Amazon.com ( AMZN ) is down 11% on no news? This is forced liquidation folks!<br>Today's Biggest Gainers - 11/12/08<br>There were a few !<br>So what now? On the Dow Jones, watch 8175, Nasdaq, 1493, SP 500, 840 ..... these are lows that must hold or else more forced selling will hit the markets. This is as bad as I've seen it yet for these stock markets. Rallying 1400 points on an Election in which everyone knew who was going to win months before it happened, and then crashing back down to retest the lows. I think we are setting up for another rip roaring rally soon! Just to much pessimism right now after everyone was high fiving each other last week! Everyone and their mother is bearish right now, typical bottom signs. Stay Tuned........ http://daytradingstockblog.blogspot.com/<br><br>
