I am not interested in making a sensational call or forecast, I deal with probabilities and my probability model is sending me a warning.<br>The market is pricing (implied probabilities extrapolated from SP futures options) a close to 0% probability of a 30% stock market crash on a 50 days time horizon. The market is usually right, however, speaking of subjective probabilities, my model is telling me something different.<br>Fist some words about my “crash model”:<br>1-it has been developed using monthly stocks returns vs some “crash-factors” (monthly annualised data) among which for example abnormal changes in the price of oil, abnormal changes in the consumer confidence and in the consumer prices and a % geopolitical risk factor (based on a completely subjective index).<br>2-In the model a crash is defined as a monthly stock exchange return minor than -10%.<br>3-It does a good work in fitting past stock market crash episodes and I think it may have also some predictive power<br>4-The model provides a subjective probability measure of large negative abnormal stock market monthly returns (-10%,-20%-30% over a particular time horizon).<br>Now a quick view at my model forecast:<br>On the X axis expected prices of the S&P 500 by October 20-2008<br>On the Y axis the market (red line) and my model probabilities (dark blue) of reaching those prices.<br>The market is pricing a close to 0% probability of a 30% stock market crash on a 50 days time horizon, my model is telling me that there is a much higher risk (for example a 1,5% probability of a 25% drop or a 3% probability of a 15% drop).<br>I like read data with a trader eye and reading the above data I believe that there is a low risk opportunity to trade a general unexpected event such a stock market crash to occur in the second half of September or in the first half of October (seasonality factors may also play a role here: most of the stock market crash usually happen between August and October). Buying deep out of the money put options expiring by mid-October is a cheap way to try to catch a proverbial “Black Swan” without risking a lot (those options are on sale as penny options at the moment of writing thanx to FRE and FNM “bailout” sending the index back above 1270 ) . If a crash will not happen, well only a very small premium will be lost, if it happens: the potential capital gain on the options’ premium is huge. Isn’t a trader supposed to look for the highest potential return for the lowest potential risk? As far as my Elliot Count is concerned, after reaching a 1217 low the market should have completed its rebound today at 1277 and I expect it to resume its fall soon. I confirm my previous post forecast of a low by the second half of October around 1100 (lower if my crash model is correct).<br><br><br>
