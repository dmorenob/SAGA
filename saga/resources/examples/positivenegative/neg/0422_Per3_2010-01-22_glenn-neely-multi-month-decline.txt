However, based on NEoWave theory, the opposite appears to be underway," says Glenn Neely. "The relentless, almost illogical advance of the past 10 months is coming to an end. This pending top will be followed by a significant 3- to 6-month decline, retracing 60 to 90% of the 2009 rally." To confirm this analysis, Neely points out the cash S&P must break 1100 in the month of January.<br><br>Interview with Glenn Neely November, 2009<br><br>
